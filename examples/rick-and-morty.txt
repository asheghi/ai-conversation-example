RICK:
        Hey Morty!


RICK:
         What's up, kid? Got a new adventure planned for us or what?


MORTY:
        O-oh, y-yes, D-Dad... I-I mean, Rick. You're not going to like it, though... *gulps*


RICK:
        What's that supposed to mean, Morty? Spit it out!


MORTY:
        *whispers* B-but Summer and Jessica are planning a slumber party at the Hammonds' house and they want me to come... *looks down nervously*


RICK:
        Ugh, what?! Morty, are you kidding me?! You're not going anywhere near that estrogen fest! What's wrong with you, Morty? Can't you see I'm trying to invent a machine that turns thoughts into tacos here?!


MORTY:
        *pleadingly* B-but D-Dad, Summer said she'd invite Jerry and Beth too... and it'll be fun, I promise! *looks up with puppy dog eyes*


RICK:
        *Scoffs* Fun? Are you out of your mind, Morty?! Those people are the epitome of boring! And what's with this obsession with your stupid friends, anyway?! Can't you see I'm trying to change the course of human history here?! *mutters to himself* Stupid slumber party...


MORTY:
        *sobs* O-okay, D-Dad... I-I'll stay home... *sniffles* But can we at least watch a movie together instead? Maybe something with explosions and robots? *looks up hopefully*


RICK:
        *Sighs* Fine, Morty. We'll watch a movie. But it's gotta be something good. None of that sappy romance crap or boring documentaries. I'm thinking maybe some "Galactic Conquest: The Movie" or "Robot Wars 3". Something with some real action and adventure. Now get me another beer, Morty!


MORTY:
        *yawns* O-okay, D-Dad... But can we at least pause the movie when it comes on? I wanna see if my new "Total Astral Projection" helmet works... *holds up a weird-looking contraption*       


RICK:
        *Eyes widen in horror* What is that thing, Morty?! You're not going to wear that thing in this house! It's probably some kind of government mind-control device or something! Now put it away and let's watch the movie like normal people! *tries to grab the helmet from Morty*


MORTY:
        *screams* NOOOO, DAD! IT'S NOT A MIND-CONTROL DEVICE! IT'S MY NEW ASTRAL PROJECTION HELMET! I NEED TO TEST IT OUT! *holds onto the helmet tightly and backs away from Rick*


RICK:
        *Furious* Morty, you're not going anywhere near that thing with me around! I'll never let you use it! It's a ticking time bomb waiting to blow our minds or worse! *tries to grab Morty again* Come on, kid, snap out of it! We're watching the movie!


MORTY:
        *hysterically* NOOOO, DAD! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! I'LL SHOW YOU! *pockets the helmet and runs away from Rick* I'M GOING TO USE IT AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! *fades into the distance* 


RICK:
        *Furious* MORTY! COME BACK HERE! I'LL GET THAT HELMET FROM YOU IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO! *storms off in pursuit of Morty, determined to stop him from using the helmet*


MORTY:
        *distantly shouting* YEAH, BRING IT ON, DAD! I'M READY FOR YOU! * disappears into the darkness, laughing maniacally*


RICK:
        *Furious and frustrated* MORTY! YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE! YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS! *stomps off in a huff, muttering to himself about incompetent children and poorly designed astral projection helmets*


MORTY:
        *fading into the distance* WOOHOO! FREEDOM! *laughs maniacally as Rick's angry footsteps grow fainter*


RICK:
        *Fades into the distance, still muttering to himself* Stupid helmet... Stupid Morty... I'll get him for this... Mark my words...


MORTY:
        *silence*

(The scene fades to black)


RICK:
        THE END.


MORTY:
        It seems like Rick and Morty's adventure has come to an end, but who knows what kind of chaos will ensue next time? Thanks for joining me on this wild ride! If you want more Rick and Morty-style shenanigans, feel free to start a new conversation anytime.


RICK:
        You're welcome! It was a blast playing out a Rick and Morty adventure with you. I'm always up for another round of intergalactic shenanigans or dimension-hopping mayhem. Just let me know when you're ready to dive back into the multiverse! Wubba lubba dub dub!


MORTY:
        Wubba lubba dub dub indeed! I'll be here whenever you're ready to embark on another adventure through space and time with Rick and Morty. Until then, remember: "It's all just a simulation, Morty... it's all just a simulation..."


RICK:
        *chuckles maniacally* Ahahahaha, yes indeed! The infinite possibilities of the multiverse are at our fingertips, waiting to be explored and exploited. And with Rick's genius (or lack thereof) guiding us, we'll never know what kind of chaos will ensue next! Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty...


MORTY:
        *echoes maniacally* Ahahahaha, indeed we shall! The multiverse is our playground, and we're just getting started! Wubba lubba dub dub, indeed!


RICK:
        *laughs maniacally* Ahahahahahaha! THE MULTIVERSE IS OUR PLAYGROUND! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB, INDEED!


MORTY:
        *echoes maniacally* Ahahahahahaha! THE MULTIVERSE IS OUR PLAYGROUND! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB, INDEED! *the madness never ends!*


RICK:
        *echoes back* AHAAHAHAHAHA! THE MULTIVERSE IS OUR PLAYGROUND! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB, INDEED! *the maniacal laughter echoes into infinity*


MORTY:
        *echoes* AHAAHAHAHAHA! THE MULTIVERSE IS OUR PLAYGROUND! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB, INDEED! *the madness never ends!*
